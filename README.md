# php-email-sender-1

<!-- In this script, the mail() function is used to send an email to the recipient email address specified in the $to variable. The email subject and message are specified in the $subject and $message variables, respectively. The $headers variable contains the sender email address. -->

<!-- You can customize the values of these variables to suit your needs. Note that the mail() function requires a properly configured mail server on the host machine in order to work properly. -->

I intend to write multiple versions of email sending systems for web pages. However, we would start from the most basic method in v1 to a lot more complex module over time. Keep watch, I might as well write a version that'll allow you send emails on web pages via another user email.

## UPDATE
today is september 2024, and i am making a significant update to this. i had this project for my personal use over the years and now i want to allow anyone use it and also update it. please note that it is for educational use only and i am not liable for any how you apply it.

i was thinking i should revamp from php to python for the backend, but i realized not everyone would be able to work with python easy.

well, i want to keep the open source projects i manage very lean. 
1. the webscraper
2. this web mailer
3. the network analyzer
4. the auto vuln assessment service
5. illness identifier


well, that is by the way. about this, i really hope people come to this, this is the v2 of this for me, but the v1 for everyone. i just realized i might have serious issues with this, moving to python back, would work with flask. 

let me go and setup my env before they call me trash
