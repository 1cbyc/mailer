# php-email-sender-1

In this script, the mail() function is used to send an email to the recipient email address specified in the $to variable. The email subject and message are specified in the $subject and $message variables, respectively. The $headers variable contains the sender email address.

You can customize the values of these variables to suit your needs. Note that the mail() function requires a properly configured mail server on the host machine in order to work properly.


## UPDATE
today is september 2024, and i am making a significant update to this. i had this project for my personal use over the years and now i want to allow anyone use it and also update it. please note that it is for educational use only and i am not liable for any how you apply it.

i was thinking i should revamp from php to python for the backend, but i realized not everyone would be able to work with python easy.

well, i want to keep the open source projects i manage very lean.
